Architecture for [this site](https://blog.scubbo.org/), image built from [here](https://gitea.scubbo.org/scubbo/blogcontent).

Created on 2025-02-26, migrating from a [now deprecated repo](https://gitea.scubbo.org/scubbo/blog-infrastructure) that I created long ago, when I knew much less about k8s setup than I do now. In particular - I didn't know that `kustomize` existed, and so had hacked-together my own implementation of the image-update functionality. Proud of myself for figuring out how to do so - but let's use the established tool now I know that it exists!
